# AI Chatbot
In my Artificial Intelligence assignment, I developed an AI contextual chatbot using the TensorFlow and TFLearn libraries. I leveraged the concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Networks to create the chatbot. For training, I created my own intents file, which served as the dataset for the chatbot to learn from.

# Dependencies
1. pip3 install nltk
2. pip3 install tensorflow==1.13.2
3. pip3 install numpy
4. pip3 install tflearn
5. pip3 install random
6. pip3 install json

# Use Cases
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI and automation have become key drivers of innovation across various industries. Among the many applications of AI and automation, chatbots have emerged as a powerful tool with numerous use cases in different sectors.

1. Labor-saving efficiency: Chatbots can handle repetitive tasks and inquiries that would otherwise require human intervention, reducing the workload on human employees and freeing them up to focus on more complex and strategic tasks.

2. 24x7 support: Chatbots can provide round-the-clock support, ensuring that customers or users can get assistance at any time of the day or night, without being limited by human working hours.

3. Instant service: Chatbots are designed to provide prompt and immediate responses to user queries or requests, offering fast and efficient service without delays or wait times.

4. Scalability: Chatbots can handle a large number of users concurrently, making them ideal for scenarios where there is a need to interact with multiple users at the same time, such as customer service, support, or information dissemination.

5. Easy communication: Chatbots facilitate seamless and user-friendly communication, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for users to engage with, enhancing the overall user experience.

6. Cost-effective: Implementing chatbots can be a cost-effective solution compared to hiring and training a large team of human customer service representatives, especially for small or medium-sized businesses.

7. Personalization: Chatbots can be programmed to provide personalized responses and recommendations based on user preferences and behavior, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

In conclusion, chatbots represent a compelling application of AI and automation in various industries, offering benefits such as labor-saving efficiency, 24x7 support, instant service, scalability, easy communication, cost-effectiveness, and personalization. As technology continues to advance, chatbots are likely to play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the future of customer service, support, and engagement.

# How to run ?
To run this application, you can use Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment of your choice. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

After running every cell, you can call the response() method, which is a placeholder for your own implementation of the neural network model. You can provide your query or input as an argument to the response() method, and the model will process it accordingly.

For example:
